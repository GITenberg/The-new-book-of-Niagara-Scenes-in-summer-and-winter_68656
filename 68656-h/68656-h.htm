<p>Favorite positions for this view are Hennepin View in Prospect Park
and the New Steel Bridge. At the left is the American Fall with Luna
Island and Goat Island dividing it from the Horseshoe Fall. The Maid of
the Mist, near her landing, and the inclined railway are minor objects
of interest.</p>

<p>A trip on the “Maid of the Mist” past the Falls is one of the most
fascinating of the experiences to be had at Niagara. The views of the
descending floods, the swirling water below and the rainbow through the
mist all lend enchantment to the trip.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>AMERICAN FALL FROM PROSPECT POINT.</p>

<p>It is while standing at or near Prospect Point that the very large
majority of people who visit Niagara get their first view of the
wondrous cataract. At one wide sweep of vision Niagara is before you
and you see the water pour over the edge of the precipice, falling with
stupendous power on the rocks below.</p>

<p>Standing on the rocks at the foot of the Inclined Railway in
Prospect Park and looking at the down-pour of water over the American
Fall, a new impression of Niagara’s greatness comes over you, and you
marvel at the beauty of the mighty flood.</p>

<p>Under the light of the full moon of summer time, when Nature has
done her best to make the locality all about delightful, the mind is
made receptive of the moonlight softness, and the beauty of the scene
impresses all with its magnificence.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>PROSPECT POINT IN WINTER.</p>

<p>In winter and summer alike Prospect Point is one of the main vantage
spots from which to view Niagara. Immediately below the Point the
mountain grows to an unlimited size as the spray freezes, and builds it
by night and by day. In the ice bridge season there is no better place
to view it than Prospect Point.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>TERRAPIN ROCK AND HORSESHOE FALL FROM GOAT ISLAND.</p>

<p>The Horseshoe or Canadian Fall, as a single object, is regarded as
the sublimest thing in Nature. The Canadian Rapids have a fall of 55
feet in three-quarters of a mile before reaching the Falls, while it
is estimated that the volume of water is ten times greater than that
passing over the American Fall.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>HORSESHOE FALL FROM BELOW.</p>

<p>The height of the Horseshoe Fall is 165 feet and the stupendous
nature of the Fall is more impressive when the visitor stands at the
water’s edge in the gorge and looks upward at the flood descending in
such graceful lines.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>TERRAPIN POINT IN WINTER.</p>

<p>The scene at Terrapin Point in winter is one of brilliancy and
splendor. The spray-cloud of the Horseshoe Fall is wafted to the
shores of Goat Island where King Winter’s breadth congeals it all to
a marble-like formation, and the snowy whiteness of the spectacle is
dazzling in the bright sunlight.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>ICE MOUNTAIN AND ICE BRIDGE.</p>

<p>The beauty of this scene varies yearly, for the wind and weather
have all to do with the magnitude of the formations. When the weather
is exceedingly cold the ice mountain, between the American Fall and the
Inclined Railway, attains a magnificent height. The ice also forms from
shore to shore, enabling people to pass at will to the Canadian side,
and forming what is popularly called the ice bridge.</p>

<p>This view shows “the dividing of the waters” of Niagara River,
and in the immediate front the American Rapids are seen flowing
tumultuously onward towards the towering cataract. Far across beyond
Goat Island are the Canadian Rapids. The greater grandeurs and
immense boundaries of which are best seen from Victoria Park on the
Canadian side.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>BRINK OF THE AMERICAN FALL.</p>

<p>Probably there is no one sight which impresses itself more strongly
upon the great majority of beholders than this view of the brink of
the American Fall. Such mighty on-rushing torrents, so powerful, yet
so smoothly and alluringly moving on over the precipice, and so near
is the visitor to what seems an abyss of destruction that the scene is
never forgotten.</p>

<p>This view across American Fall is one never to be forgotten. Here
the brink of the Fall is seen in all its beauty, while far across
the Fall, Prospect Park, with its constant crowds, forms part of the
picture. A fine view of the Upper Steel Bridge is also here enjoyed.</p>

made. “The scene is entrancing as the searchlight kisses the water into
new beauty.”</p>

<p>The Whirlpool Rapids begin within sight of the Falls. The gorge

40 miles an hour and the foam-crested waters are entrancingly
beautiful.</p>

<p>The Whirlpool is about two miles below the Falls and is the greatest
known river pocket. Into it the Rapids plunge in all their fury, and a
gyrating motion is given the entire body of water. Here the river turns
at right angles, causing one of the most mysterious and fascinating
features of this mighty stream of water.</p>

<p>This is one of the grand views to be had from the Canadian side of
the river. The rapids, by their great descent and vastness, convey
an impressive effect to the mind, and, together with the Falls and
scenery of Victoria Park, combines to make one of the most pleasing
pictures about Niagara. The entire length of the park is traversed by
the electric cars, which are so great a convenience about Niagara, for
tourists.</p>

<p>Standing in Victoria Park, one gets a full front view of the
American Fall, while at the right of the scene is Center Fall, flowing
between Luna and Goat Islands. The American Fall has a width of 1,000
feet, a height of 158 feet, while the Rapids above descend forty feet
in a half mile. All visitors should go to the Canadian side for the
Canadian Fall and Rapids, the most imposing features of the Falls, are
there best seen with their wonderful rainbow and mist effects, while
the beauties of Victoria Park itself well repay a visit.</p>

<p>The life work of Niagara River has been and continues to be the
digging of the Niagara Gorge through which it flows. Those who have
studied the subject thoroughly have reached the conclusion that the
great trench was excavated by the running of the river itself. In its
length, the gorge is in one sense a measure of the age of the river.</p>

all scenic features. The objects of interest along the Gorge Route are

<p>The intensity of the mighty grasp of winter is at no point better

waters are chilled and frozen until where yesterday the river plunged
over the precipice in gleeful, laughing manner, huge stalactites of ice
are hung reaching from the cliff-top to the slope below.</p>

<p>In February, 1896, for a period of four days, the Cave of the Winds
was dry, the water of the Fall being kept back by the ice formation.
Visitors sought the cavern and roamed about admiring the icy scenes on
every side. The photograph for the picture above was then made, and it
may never be possible to obtain the same again.</p>

<p>The Ice Palace, a thing of beauty in the production of which man
essayed to supplement Nature, was erected in the State Reservation
in the winter of 1898. “An area of 120 by 160 feet was covered by
its gleaming walls of crystal. The entire structure was gay with
bunting and flags by day and brilliant with electrical illumination by
night.”</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
